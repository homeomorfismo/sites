# About me

I’m Gabriel Pinochet Soto, a 25-year-old graduate student at [Portland State University](https://www.pdx.edu/).
I’m doing my Ph.D. in Mathematical Sciences; I started in Fall 2021.
Previously, I got my Master and Bachelor degree in Mathematics at [Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso](https://pucv.cl/).
I also attended [IMPA](https://impa.br/)’s summer school in 2019 and the [Second NGSolve user meeting](https://ngsolve.org/news/2nd-ngsolve-user-meeting) in  2018.

I like math. I like (most of) analysis. My current interests are functional analysis, numerical analysis, and numerical methods for differential equations. In particular, I have some work related to numerical methods for production-destruction models and resistivity measurements in axisymmetrical settings.

*Currently*, my favorite Theorems are Grothendieck’s characterization of compact sets in normed spaces, Banach’s fixed point principle, and Arzelà-Ascoli Theorem. My favorite proof is Urysohn’s Lemma proof by indexing separating sets with dyadic numbers.

I also like to play guitar, pretend I can write songs and poetry, read comics, watch shows, and listen to music while biking around the waterfront. I’ve been living in [Portland, Oregon](https://www.portland.gov/), for more than a year. Previously, I lived in [Viña del Mar](https://www.chile.travel/en/where-to-go/destination/vina-del-mar/) and [Rio de Janeiro](https://www.riodejaneiro.com/).
