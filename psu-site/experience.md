# Intern, Comp-Scholar, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA. Summer 2023

I worked at LLNL as an Intern, under the [Computing Scholar Program](https://computing.llnl.gov/sites/default/files/scholar-expo-flier-final.pdf).
My mentor was [Dr. Chak Shing Lee](https://people.llnl.gov/lee1029), with contributions from [Dr. Panayot S. Vassilevski](https://web.pdx.edu/~panayot/).
Our work focused on implementing and comparing different block-solvers for the discretization of Darcy equations. 
In particular, we implemented a Bramble-Pasciak transformation to the system, that allows the application of conjugate gradient for systems that are not symmetric positive definite. 
We also implemented a reduced preconditioned conjugate gradient iteration that relies on a specific choice of the preconditioner.
This work was implemented in MFEM, and we expect it to be available in the set of miniapps MFEM enjoys.

# Givens, Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, IL. Summer 2022

I worked at ANL as a Givens Intern.
My mentor was [Dr. Richard Mills](https://climatemodeling.org/~rmills/).
Our work focuses on evaluate, improve, and extend the interfaces to underlying PETSc solvers in two software packages, NGSolve and Firedrake, that provide high-level tools to automate the solution of partial differential equations (PDEs) using finite element methods.
A particular focus is enabling the effective use of GPU accelerator devices to solve the algebraic systems of equations arising from PDE discretizations; we will also explore extending interfaces to use higher-level solver components (nonlinear solvers, timesteppers, numerical optimizers) as well as providing support for physics-based block preconditioners.

# GTA & GRA, Portland State University, Portland, OR. Fall 2021 - Today

During my first year in the Ph.D. program, I got a graduate teaching assistant position.
More details related to the teaching work are in the [Teaching](/~gpin2/teach) tab.
Currently, I am a graduate research assistant, involved in the [research training group in computation and data enabled science](https://sites.google.com/pdx.edu/rtg-in-cades) (as an *interesed trainee*) under the supervision of [Dr. Jay Gopalakrishnan](https://web.pdx.edu/~gjay/). More details soon to be included.

### Other positions

### Secretary, [SIAM PDX Student Chapter](https://sites.google.com/pdx.edu/siampdx/). Fall 2022 - Today

I contribute with my colleagues to generate STEM-related instances for exploration in those topics under an undergraduate-and-graduate-friendly format.
