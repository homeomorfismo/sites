# Givens, Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, IL. Summer 2022

I worked at ANL as a Givens Intern. My mentor was [Dr. Richard Mills](https://climatemodeling.org/~rmills/). Our work focuses on evaluate, improve, and extend the interfaces to underlying PETSc solvers in two software packages, NGSolve and Firedrake, that provide high-level tools to automate the solution of partial differential equations (PDEs) using finite element methods. A particular focus is enabling the effective use of GPU accelerator devices to solve the algebraic systems of equations arising from PDE discretizations; we will also explore extending interfaces to use higher-level solver components (nonlinear solvers, timesteppers, numerical optimizers) as well as providing support for physics-based block preconditioners.

# GTA & GRA, Portland State University, Portland, OR. Fall 2021 - Today

During my first year in the Ph.D. program, I got a graduate teaching assistant position. More details related to the teaching work are in the [Teaching](/~gpin2/teach) tab. Currently, I am a graduate research assistant, involved in the [research training group in computation and data enabled science](https://sites.google.com/pdx.edu/rtg-in-cades) (as an *interesed trainee*) under the supervision of [Dr. Jay Gopalakrishnan](https://web.pdx.edu/~gjay/). More details soon to be included.
